# Security Policy – CollectiVAI

CollectiVAI is an experimental, pre-production project.  
Even so, we take security and responsible disclosure seriously.

This policy applies to all repositories under the `collectiv-ai` organisation.

---

## 1. Supported repos

Security reports are most relevant for:

- `collectiv-ai-app` – iOS / iPadOS / macOS client  
- `collectiv-ai-app-chain` – Cosmos-based App-Chain (pre-alpha)  
- `collectiv-ai.github.io` – website & public docs  
- any future backend / routing components

Other repositories (branding, business plan, about-founder, sponsors, etc.)  
are mostly documentation and less security-critical, but you can still report issues.

---

## 2. Reporting a vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security issue, please **do not open a public issue**.

Instead, contact:

- **E-mail:** `info@collectivai.org`  
  Subject suggestion: `SECURITY – <short summary>`  

Please include:

- which repository and component is affected,  
- a short description of the issue,  
- how to reproduce it (proof of concept),  
- any potential impact you see.

If you can, also mention:

- OS / platform (e.g. iOS 18, macOS 15, Ubuntu 22.04),  
- version/commit of the project you tested.

We prefer **plain text or simple Markdown** reports.

---

## 3. What we do with your report

We will:

1. Acknowledge receipt of your report as soon as reasonably possible.  
2. Analyse and verify the issue.  
3. Plan a fix or mitigation where appropriate.  
4. Decide how and when to disclose the issue publicly.

If you wish, we can **credit you** in release notes or security advisories,  
unless you prefer to remain anonymous.

---

## 4. Scope & principles

Please:

- Do **not** use security issues to access, modify or delete data that does not belong to you.  
- Do **not** perform denial-of-service attacks.  
- Do **not** exploit issues beyond what is necessary to demonstrate them.  

CollectiVAI is an independent, small-scale project.  
We cannot offer monetary bug bounties at this time,  
but we deeply appreciate responsible disclosure and will credit your help.

---

## 5. Out of scope

The following are generally out of scope:

- vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies that we do not control,  
  (but feel free to highlight them so we can update/patch),  
- issues that require physical access to a local test machine,  
- social engineering attacks against individuals.

If you are unsure whether something is in scope, you can still send a **short email**  
and ask before going deeper.

Thank you for helping to keep CollectiVAI safe and trustworthy.
