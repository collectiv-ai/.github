## How to get started

1. **Browse existing issues**

   - Look for issues labelled `good first issue`, `help wanted` or similar.
   - If something is unclear, ask in the issue before starting work.

2. **Open an issue before larger changes**

   - For new features or bigger refactors:  
     open an issue describing:
     - what you want to change,
     - why it is useful,
     - how you roughly plan to implement it.

   This helps to align expectations and avoid duplicate work.

3. **Fork & branch**

   - Fork the repository you want to contribute to.
   - Create a descriptive branch name, e.g.  
     `feature/add-contracts-filter` or `fix/typo-chain-docs`.

## Pull request guidelines

When submitting a PR:

- **Keep it focused**

  Prefer small, well-scoped changes over huge “mega PRs”.

- **Explain the change**

  In the PR description, include:
  - what you changed,
  - why you changed it,
  - any side effects or breaking changes.

- **Link related issues**

  If there is a related issue, reference it with  
  `Closes #123` or `Relates to #123`.

- **Style & languages**

  - code: follow existing style in the repo (Swift, Go, Shell, etc.),
  - docs: English is preferred, German is welcome where appropriate,
  - keep language clear, respectful and accessible.

---

## Documentation & writing

Contributions to documentation are **highly appreciated**:

- improving clarity in existing docs,
- fixing typos or broken links,
- adding examples or diagrams,
- translating small sections (EN/DE) where it helps understanding.

Please avoid adding promotional or marketing content –  
the focus is on **clarity, transparency and public understanding**.

---

## Security & sensitive topics

If your contribution touches **security**, **cryptography**, **blockchain nodes**,  
or other sensitive areas:

- be extra careful not to include:
  - secrets, API keys, private endpoints,
  - personal data or system identifiers,
- describe expected security implications in the PR description,
- if you believe you found a vulnerability, please follow  
  the [`SECURITY.md`](./SECURITY.md) process instead of opening a public issue.

---

## Questions & ideas

If you are unsure where to start:

- open a small “question / idea” issue,
- or reach out via the contact details on the website:  
  **https://collectivai.org**

Thank you for helping to shape CollectiVAI as a **democratic, human-centred AI ecosystem**. 🙌
